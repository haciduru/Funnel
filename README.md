# Funnel
Sometimes we need to graph funnel effects. This is a simple function that shows funnel effects.

Sometimes we need to present funnel effects. For example, there are many crimes committed every day. Not all of them are reported to the police. Some of them are though. Once police learn about a crime, they try to catch them, but they can only catch only some of the criminals. Once caught, criminals go to the court, and some of them are convicted. Most of them are not. Of those who were convicted, some of them go to prison, but most of them don't. So, this is a typical funnel effect. This function shows how the numbers in such effects look like.
